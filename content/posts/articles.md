## 1. Dan Abramov, The WET codebase

This Dan's talk is a big one for me. At this time, I was working on a project that was quite badly maintained, 
written by mostly beginner developers. The codebase was certainly far from flawless, but I often cought myself thinking:

> Why do I sometimes find beginners code so much easier to work with, even if 
> it's sometimes copy-pasty/naive/unstructured?

Well, this talk gives the answer for that. 

I think after a certain point, we all developers strive to write "clean" code,
use Bob's solid patterns, etc. But this often compromises the readability (which is â„–1 priority imo) and can shoot ourselves in the foot.
The key takeaway from this talk for me was this basic idea:

> Bad abstractions are worse than copy-pasting

They are. They are harder to maintain, and come at the worst cost, than code duplicaiton. The latter is obviously also bad and 
a form of technical dept, but often less dangerous.

## 2. Rich Harris, Transitional apps

A classic Rich Harris talk that made me think about traditional web page vs. SPA thing. Looking at the bigger picture of 
web, it's past and where it's all going is really valuable. And of course Rich is one of the most 
respected people in frontend for me.

## 3. Ryan Carniato, breaking down the web
