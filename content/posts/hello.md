Welcome to my blog! My name is Valeriy and I'm from Russia (I should start adding 'pro-Ukraine', after saying this probably). 

I'm currently working at
[CIAN](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/cian-group) as a React Frontend developer. I created this blog to document 
my journey, and also for having a place to vent in the unease place and time I live. I plan to touch on both technical and non-technical topics here, we'll se how it goes. 

This blog is opensourced, and the repo can be found here: [https://github.com/va3y/blog](https://github.com/va3y/blog).
