Welcome to my blog! My name is Valeriy and I'm from Russia (I gotta start adding here 'pro-Ukraine', post-2022, I really am). 

I'm currently working at
a real-estate Classified: [CIAN](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/cian-group), as a React Front-end developer. 
I created this blog to document my journey, and have a place to vent in the unease place and time I live. I plan to touch on both technical and non-technical topics here, we'll see how it goes. 

This blog is open sourced, its repo is here: [https://github.com/va3y/blog](https://github.com/va3y/blog).
